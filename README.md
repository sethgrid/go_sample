=========

Sample Go application for testing deployment processes.

To get started, you must set your GOPATH. This command sets the GOPATH and displays your PATH. Make sure Go is in your path. 
`source set_go_path.sh`

To build the binary:
`cd src/helloworld && go build`

This puts the binary in the bin directory. 

Run the binary:
`cd bin && ./helloworld`
