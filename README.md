=========

Sample Go application for testing deployment processes.

To get started, you must set your GOPATH. This command sets the GOPATH and displays your PATH. Make sure Go is in your path. 
`source set_go_path.sh`

To run the test:
`go test helloworld`

To build the binary:
`go install helloworld`

This puts the binary in the bin directory. 

Run the binary:
`./bin/helloworld`
